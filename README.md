# PHBS_ASP_2018
[Applied Stochastic Processes](https://github.com/PHBS/2018.M1.ASP) class taught by prof. Jaehyuk Choi at Peking University HSBC Business School Shenzhen, China

## HW 2
Corporate Bond Pricing:
* creating a pricing function
* improving the function by reducing the MC variations
* comparing with the analytic value of the corporate bond

## HW 3
1) Basket option implementation based on:
* normal model
* BSM model
2) Spread option implementation based on:
* normal model
* BSM model
3) Variance Control(CV): 
* comparison of the MC standard deviation of BSM basket prices obtained with and without CV

## HW 4
SABR Model Test Code:
1) Pricing using Hagan's formula (provided):
* SABR for 0<β≤1
* SABR for β=0
* smile calibration to 3 options
2) Pricing under MC method

## FINAL PROJECT
An industrial solution to attaining implied volatility through option prices using minimal iterations and maximal precision:
* iplementation of the method described in a paper called "Let's be rational" by Peter Jackel (2016)
